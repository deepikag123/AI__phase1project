## Dependencies

Before running the code, you need to ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for running the provided Jupyter notebooks)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib jupyter
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepikag123/house-price-prediction.git
```

2. Change directory to the project folder:

```bash
cd house-price-prediction
```

## Usage

The project consists of the following main components:

## Data

The data used for training and testing the model can be found in the `data` directory. The dataset contains various features related to houses, including their prices.

# Data Source:(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vedavyasv/usa-housing)

### Model Training

The model training script is provided in the `train.py` file. To train the model, run the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

This script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and save the trained model to a file.

### Prediction

To make predictions using the trained model, you can use the `predict.py` script. It takes input data and returns the predicted house prices. Example usage:

```bash
python predict.py --input input_data.csv --output predictions.csv
```

### Evaluation

To evaluate the model's performance, use the `evaluate.py` script. It calculates metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared for the model's predictions.

```bash
python evaluate.py --predictions predictions.csv --ground-truth ground_truth.csv
```
